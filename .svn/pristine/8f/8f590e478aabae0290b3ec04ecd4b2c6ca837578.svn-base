*************************************
A valid cell:
	The first character is an underscore or a letter.
	This is followed by zero or more underscores, letters or digits.

Spreadsheet has a cell for every possible cell name.
Each cell has contents & a value.
	Contents can be:
		String
		Double
		Formula
	Value can be:
		String
		Double
		FormulaError

In a new spreadsheet, the contents of each cell is an empty string.
If a cell's content is a Formula, it's value is either a double or a FormulaError.
	This is determined by Formula.Evaluate

The value of a variable is the value of the Spreadsheet cell it names.
	This can be a double value only; undefined otherwise.

A cell can not depend on itself: this is called a circular dependency.

Cell Class:
The Cell class will be used to contain all the useful information needed to create one cell.

Formula library:
Formula can be used to evaluate formulas and return either a double value or a FormulaError

DependencyGraph library:
This will be used to avoid circular dependency among cells.
