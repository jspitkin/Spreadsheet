# Spreadsheet

A simple responsive spreadsheet written using C# for Software Practice I (CS 3500) during the Fall 2014 semester.

This spreadsheet applicaiton has a built in formula evaluator which allows math formulas to be evaluated. Cells can be used as variables to do math between cells. Recursive checks are done to disallow cells being dependent on each other in a circular fashion.
